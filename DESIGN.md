First, I will need 2 helper functions, positions and contains. Contains will be a boolean where it takes an input of a char letter and a char* word. I will loop over all the letters in word and if the letter in word[i] equals letter then I return true, else I return false. Positions will be similar to contains in that it is a boolean where it takes an input of a char letter and a char* word and also int postion but now if the letter in word[i] equals letter and i equals position then I return true. Score_letter will be a for loop where I am looping over all the words in vocabulary and checking if word doesnt equal null and if strchr(word, letter) is true, then count would increase at the end I return count. For score_word I loop over thw words in vocabulary and check if word doesnt equal null and if strchr(word, letter) is true, then I get the score of the word by adding the word score to count and return count and the end. Filter yellow I check if contains and position is true for the word then I set vocabulary of that index to null. Filter gray I check if contains is false for the word then I set vocabulary of that index to null. Filter green I check if contains and position is false for the word then I set vocabulary of that index to null.
